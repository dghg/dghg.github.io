  1. Unlike the problem sets, you have only ONE attempt per 24 hours. Thus DO NOT START THE EXAM until you are ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. There are 10 questions, and each is worth 1 point. Many are of the "select all that apply" type, rather than the strict multiple choice format that is more common on the problem sets. You will receive partial credit for each option that you leave correctly checked or correctly unchecked. (So if you mark 4 out of the 5 options for a problem correctly, you'll receive 0.8 out of the 1 point.) You need 7 points total to pass the exam. All questions are about material covered in the required (i.e., non-optional) videos.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Roughly half of the questions follow fairly directly from the lecture material (assuming that you understand it thoroughly). Roughly a quarter of the questions are variations on problem set questions. Roughly a quarter of the questions demand more thought, for example by asking you to consider whether certain results from lecture do or do not extend to more general situations.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Good luck!
